### Java Edition - Data pack
#### (Compatible with all MC versions 1.14 - 1.17 snapshots)

A Datapack that lets you and your players become Minato Namikaze from Naruto.  
(Craft Tridents into Teleportation Kunai)
      
                  Version 11.4 or Higher Recommended!
      (A reinstall is recomended if you update to 11.4+ from older versions)
      (as well as re-crafting your current Trident(s) and Raijin Link Items)

### Use:

      To craft a Raijin Trident, Get Any Trident, a Eye of Ender and a Name Tag, throw them
      on top of an enchanting table within 5 blocks of yourself, and your trident will be transformed 
      and you will get a special carrot on a stick.
      (You can also throw an old Named/enchanted Carrot on a stick into 
      the crafting mix to upgrade it to a Raijin Carrot.)
      To Use the Raijin, Throw the trident and Right click the carrot on a stick.

      You Can Rename and Enchant your Raijin trident before or after its been Raijinified. 
      (same with the carrot on a stick)
      (in 10.8 the carrot on a stick got a custom resource pack, but in order to see it 
      you must re-craft the Raijin.  make sure you throw the carrot on the ground first, 
      or simply do not have a carrot on a stick in your inventory.)
      
      (Version 8.6 for Classic Version)
