      Old Pack Info: (8.6 and Older)
      Install the datapack as you normally would,
      Now find a trident and a carrot on a stick, throw the trident, 
      and while its airborn right click the carrot on a stick.
      -9.0+ OLD Info:
      If you update from 8.6 or a previous version to 9.9 or LOWER you will have to create a new trident using the crafting method.
      Do not use an enchanted trident to craft a Raijin, it will destroy the enchants.
