            Version 11.1.2 or Higher Recommended!

      (Paste resource pack into resource pack folder.)
      Paste the datapack into your .minecraft/saves/world/datapacks folder.

Use:

      To craft a Raijin Trident, Get Any Trident, a Eye of Ender and a Name Tag, throw them
      on top of an enchanting table within 5 blocks of yourself, and your trident will be transformed 
      and you will get a special carrot on a stick.
      (You can also throw an old Named/enchanted Carrot on a stick into 
      the crafting mix to upgrade it to a Raijin Carrot.)

      You Can Rename and Enchant your Raijin trident before or after its been Raijinified. 
      (same with the carrot on a stick)
      (in 10.8 the carrot on a stick got a custom resource pack, but in order to see it 
      you must re-craft the Raijin.  make sure you throw the carrot on the ground first, 
      or simply do not have a carrot on a stick in your inventory.)

Big thanks to たくぱんちゃんねる for showcasing the pack!

      
      Old Pack Info: (8.6 and Older)
      Install the datapack as you normally would,
      Now find a trident and a carrot on a stick, throw the trident,
      and while its airborn right click the carrot on a stick.
      -9.0+ OLD Info:
      If you update from 8.6 or a previous version to 9.9 or LOWER you will have to create a new trident using the crafting method.
      Do not use an enchanted trident to craft a Raijin, it will destroy the enchants.
