      Hiraishin no jutsu

      Java Edition 1.14+ Compatible
      (Compatible with 1.14+ - 1.15+)
      A Datapack that lets you and your players become Minato Namikaze from Naruto.
      (Craft Tridents into Teleportation Kunai)
      
            Version 10.8 or Higher Recommended!
      
      Install datapack in your world/datapacks folder.
      To craft a Raijin Trident, Get Any Trident, a Eye of Ender and a Name Tag, throw them all near each other
      on the ground, and your trident will be transformed and you will get a special carrot on a stick.
      (You can also throw an old Named/enchanted Carrot on a stick into 
      the crafting mix to upgrade it to a Raijin Carrot.)
      To Use the Raijin, Throw the trident and Right click the carrot on a stick.
      
      You Can Rename and Enchant your Raijin trident before or after its been Raijinified. 
      (same with the carrot on a stick)
      (in 10.8 the carrot on a stick got a custom resource pack, but in order to see it 
      you must re-craft the Raijin.  make sure you throw the carrot on the ground first, 
      or simply do not have a carrot on a stick in your inventory.)
      
      (Version 8.6 for Classic Version)

      I hope you enjoy!

      Thanks to MR.Programs for helping me put this together. <3
      
      Old Pack Info: (8.6 and Older)
      Install the datapack as you normally would,
      Now find a trident and a carrot on a stick, throw the trident,
      and while its airborn right click the carrot on a stick.
      -9.0+ OLD Info:
      If you update from 8.6 or a previous version to 9.9 or LOWER you will have to create a new trident using the crafting method.
      Do not use an enchanted trident to craft a Raijin, it will destroy the enchants.
